Typescript client for the Polymarket CLOB

### Usage

```ts
//npm install @polymarket/clob-client
//npm install ethers
//Client initialization example and dumping API Keys

import { ApiKeyCreds, ClobClient, OrderType, Side, } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { Wallet } from "@ethersproject/wallet";

const host = 'https://clob.polymarket.com';
const funder = '';//This is your Polymarket Profile Address, where you send UDSC to. 
const signer = new Wallet(""); //This is your Private Key. If using email login export from https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket otherwise export from your Web3 Application


//In general don't create a new API key, always derive or createOrDerive
const creds = new ClobClient(host, 137, signer).createOrDeriveApiKey();

//0: Browser Wallet(Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, etc)
//1: Magic/Email Login
const signatureType = 1; 
  (async () => {
    const clobClient = new ClobClient(host, 137, signer, await creds, signatureType, funder);
    const resp2 = await clobClient.createAndPostOrder(
        {
            tokenID: "", //Use https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/gamma-markets-api/get-markets to grab a sample token
            price: 0.01,
            side: Side.BUY,
            size: 5,
        },
        { tickSize: "0.001",negRisk: false }, //You'll need to adjust these based on the market. Get the tickSize and negRisk T/F from the get-markets above
        //{ tickSize: "0.001",negRisk: true },

        OrderType.GTC, 
    );
    console.log(resp2)
  })();
```
### Authentication levels

The CLOB API exposes multiple authentication levels (L0, L1, L2).  
For most trading use-cases you should use an L1 or L2 API key created from your Polymarket account, instead of a raw private key.

- **L0** – read-only methods such as fetching markets and order books.  
- **L1** – trading methods signed with an API key derived from your account (recommended for bots and scripts).  
- **L2** – high-trust operations which may require additional permissions.

See the Polymarket CLOB docs for full details and up-to-date examples: https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/quickstart.
